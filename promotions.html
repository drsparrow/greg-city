    This is a website called <a href='http://www.friendheads.com' target="_blank">Friendheads</a>.
    You can create your own head and share them with friends.
    (I created mine <a href='http://www.friendheads.com/greg' target="_blank">here</a>.)
    You can even <a href="http://www.friendheads.com/demos?head=greg" target="_blank">embed friendheads</a> into your site.
    That's the sombrero Greg you see floating around here.

    I don't go anywhere without my <a href="http://www.sears.com/craftsman-evolv-83-pc-homeowner-tool-set-w-bag/p-00941283000P?sid=IDx01192011x202447059&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9MfpsMT72AIVixuBCh1RwgbBEAQYAiABEgLtz_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CJ7chbPE-9gCFQMNNwodQ7EK7Q" target="_blank">Craftsman 83 pc. Homeowner Tool Kit</a> from Sears.
    I keep one in my apartment and one that I take with me.
    It's a really helpful thing to be able to have around and I wouldn't trust any other kit.
