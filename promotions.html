  <h4 id='friendheads'>Friendheads</h4>


  <a href='http://www.friendheads.com' target="_blank"><img src="images/friendheads.jpg"></a>
  <p class='promotion'>
    This is a website called <a href='http://www.friendheads.com' target="_blank">Friendheads</a>.
    You can create your own head and share them with friends.
    (I created mine <a href='http://www.friendheads.com/greg' target="_blank">here</a>.)
    You can even <a href="http://www.friendheads.com/demos?head=greg" target="_blank">embed friendheads</a> into your site.
    That's the sombrero Greg you see floating around here.

  <h4 id='homeowner-tool-kit'>Craftsman Homeowner Tool Kit</h4>

  <a href="{{page.toolkit-link}}" target="_blank"><img src="images/toolkit.png"></a>
  <p class='promotion'>
    I don't go anywhere without my <a href="{{page.toolkit-link}}" target="_blank">Craftsman 83 pc. Homeowner Tool Kit</a> from Sears.
    I keep one in my apartment and one that I take with me.
    It's a really helpful thing to be able to have around and I wouldn't trust any other kit.

  <h4 id='greg-meets-bagel'>Coffee Meets Bagel</h4>

  <a href="https://coffeemeetsbagel.com/" target="_blank"><img src="images/coffee.png"></a>
  <p class='promotion'>
    I'm in my mid to late 20s, so I like to meet mature women who are ready to be in a serious relationship.
    Apps like Tinder, Bumble, Ashley Madison, etc. just don't do it for me any more.
    That's why I've switched to <a href="https://twitter.com/coffeeMbagel">#CMB</a> and I am never looking back except for sometimes Tinder and Bumble when I'm in a new area.
